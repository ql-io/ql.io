* Include version number in `User-Agent` and `Server` headers.

## Feb 19, 2012

* Support scatter-gather for requests with bodies by adding a `foreach 'param'` for the

## Feb 14, 2012

* "/ecv" check returns network ip instead of loopback address
* Let the engine allow a monkey patch to parse the response. Useful to process binary formats
  like avro.
* HTML interface for `/routes` and `/tables`. You can get JSON by either include
  `Accept: application/json` or query param `json=true`.

## Feb 13, 2012

* Downgrade nodeunit
* Version 0.4
* Propagate `connection.remoteAddress` to scripts and patches. Scripts can access this via
  `{remoteAddress}` and patches via `params.remoteAddress`.

* Send resourceUri, statement, params to `patch status`, `patch uri`, and `patch response`.
* Due to a previous change, `validate params` was not receiving all params. Fixed now.

## Feb 02, 2012

* Fix to make Routes case sensitive 
* Type concercion during xml2json

## Feb 01, 2012

* Report start of the statement and not the end for line numbers in the console
* Remove mistakenly added debug: true in app.js
* New config parameter 'enable q', a boolean, is added to console to disable '/q?s=' way of invoking scripts.

## Jan 31, 2012

  Multiple conditions are ANDed ('and' === and).

## Jan 25, 2012

* Support for extended xml content-types returned  per rfc: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt

* Integrate HAR view (https://github.com/s3u/har-view) replacing the vanilla tree view.

## Jan 18, 2012

* Re-integrate ECV

## Jan 17, 2012

* Limit response size to 10000000 bytes from upstream sources. You can change this with
  `maxResponseLength` in the config.
* Limit outgoing requests per statement to 50. You can change this with `maxRequests` in the config.
* Chain events for logging done with log-emitter.
* Add a new JSON based interface to browse tables and routes. Try `/routes` to start browsing.
* Move from cluster module to the native cluster.
* Refresh all dependencies.
* Change node.js dependency to 0.6.x.

## Jan 17, 2012

* [ql.io-compiler-0.3.1] Supported a wider range of characters in quoted words in statements.

## MISSING UPDATES
## Dec 16, 2011

- Clients can occasionally get socket hangup errors when origin servers close connections without
  sending a `Connection: close` header. See https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1135 for some
  background. To avoid such errors, http.request.js now automatically retries the request once
  provided the statement that caused the HTTP request is a `select`.

- The engine can now consume CSV response in addition to XML and JSON.

- Fixed request body processing for routes (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/pull/161).


## Dec 08, 2011

- OAuth example (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/issues/121) - OAuth2 is trivial as ql.io proxies
 headers from clients to servers. OAuth1 requires glue code to compute the Authorization header.
 http://ql.io/docs/oauth shows an example of how to that.

- Use npm installed modules for ql.io-site (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/issues/116)

- Handle empty response bodies gracefully (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/issues/98)

- Recover from partial failures in case of scatter-gather calls
 (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/issues/90) - some statements can result in multiple HTTP requests.
 When this happens, the engine used to fail the entire statement if any of those requests fail. The
 engine now looks for success responses and aggregates them.

- Update CodeMirror to support line-wrapping (https://github.com/ql-io/ql.io/issues/11) - no need
 to split lines manually anymore.

## Nov 29, 2001

- Initial public release
