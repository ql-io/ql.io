The MacBook Pro delivered as advertised in terms of speed and performance.\r\n\r\nOnly problem was that when purchasing the Apple Care warranty, it only was three months short of the promised 3 year coverage.  The seller claims they will stand behind the product for the final 3 months.",

After about a day playing around with the Macbook Pro, I feel pretty proficient. I switched over to Apple for Music and other multimedia applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nWish I bought one sooner. Certainly worth the money and could have saved me thousands in the long run.",
